# BikeObstacleGame

Idea for a Biking game, where the user pedals to go faster, and coasts or hits brakes to go slower. Random obstacles appear, and the user can exist in one of 3 lanes. Created circa 2014 in order to familiarize myself with Java, never progressed to creating animations (game physics seems to work)
